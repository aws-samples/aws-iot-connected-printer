# AWS Native Connected Printer


## About this Project

This solution deploys backend Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources to support a fully cloud-based and event-driven Connected Printer solution using AWS IoT Core and the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) developed in Python](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-python.html). This solution will also deploy a front-end react application for interacting with the backend resources.

Deploying this solution does not guarantee an organizationâ€™s compliance with any laws, certifications, policies, or other regulations.
